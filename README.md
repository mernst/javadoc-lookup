# javadoc-lookup

The javadoc-lookup project consists of two parts:

* Emacs commands that look up Java API documentation, displaying it in a browser.
* A Java program `CreateJavadocIndex` that creates the index files used by the
  Emacs commands.  See its [API
  documentation](https://plumelib.org/javadoc-lookup/api/org/plumelib/javadoclookup/CreateJavadocIndex.html)
